# Mobile-App
The Gambia Red Cross Society is dedicated to promoting health and saving lives. In line with this mission, we propose the development of a mobile app focused on first aid education and emergency response. The app aims to provide accessible and practical information to individuals across The Gambia, empowering them with life-saving skills.
